# Offline, mobile ESV Bible

A [progressive web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app) built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) that uses the [ESV V2 API](http://www.esvapi.org/api/). Content is cached for offline use.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/esvbible/esvbible.github.io.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/esvbible/esvbible.github.io)
