# The Everywhere Bible app

A [progressive web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app) built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) that uses the [ESV V2 API](http://www.esvapi.org/api/). The app works offline when service workers are supported.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/everywherebible/app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/everywherebible/app)

## Development

### Set up

Get [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and run:

    yarn install

### Dev server and tooling

Start the dev server and open http://localhost:3000

    yarn start

You can also optionally start the type checker and unit tests (in separate terminals, since they've got watchers):

    yarn typecheck
    yarn test

## Deploying

Push to the `master` branch and wait for [the Travis build](https://travis-ci.org/everywherebible/app) to run.

There's this weird thing about the deployment: the site is hosted statically by
the https://github.com/esvbible/esvbible.github.io repository, and [fronted by
Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/)
at the en.everywherebible.org subdomain. The everywherebible.github.io page is
already used for the splash page explaining this project, and originally the
app was deployed to that `esvbible` org, so when it was migrated to the
`everywherebible` org, I just continued to use the original location for
hosting.
