<p id="p43010001_06-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v43010001-1">10:1&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010002-1">2&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010003-1">3&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010004-1">4&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010005-1">5&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v43010006-1">6&nbsp;</b>This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.</p>
<p id="p43010006_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43010007-1">7&nbsp;</b>So Jesus again said to them, <span class="woc">“Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010008-1">8&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010009-1">9&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010010-1">10&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010011-1">11&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010012-1">12&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010013-1">13&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010014-1">14&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010015-1">15&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010016-1">16&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010017-1">17&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010018-1">18&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.”</span></p>
<p id="p43010018_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43010019-1">19&nbsp;</b>There was again a division among the Jews because of these words. <b class="verse-num" id="v43010020-1">20&nbsp;</b>Many of them said, “He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him?” <b class="verse-num" id="v43010021-1">21&nbsp;</b>Others said, “These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”</p>
<h3 id="p43010021_06-1">I and the Father Are One</h3>
<p id="p43010021_12-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43010022-1">22&nbsp;</b>At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter, <b class="verse-num" id="v43010023-1">23&nbsp;</b>and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon. <b class="verse-num" id="v43010024-1">24&nbsp;</b>So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.” <b class="verse-num" id="v43010025-1">25&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">“I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me,</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010026-1">26&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">but you do not believe because you are not among my sheep.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010027-1">27&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010028-1">28&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010029-1">29&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">My Father, who has given them to me,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot;&gt;Some manuscripts &lt;i&gt;What my Father has given to me&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010030-1">30&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">I and the Father are one.”</span></p>
<p id="p43010030_12-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43010031-1">31&nbsp;</b>The Jews picked up stones again to stone him. <b class="verse-num" id="v43010032-1">32&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">“I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v43010033-1">33&nbsp;</b>The Jews answered him, “It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.” <b class="verse-num" id="v43010034-1">34&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">“Is it not written in your Law, ‘I said, you are gods’?</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010035-1">35&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be broken—</span><b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010036-1">36&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010037-1">37&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me;</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43010038-1">38&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v43010039-1">39&nbsp;</b>Again they sought to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.</p>
<p id="p43010039_12-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43010040-1">40&nbsp;</b>He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained. <b class="verse-num" id="v43010041-1">41&nbsp;</b>And many came to him. And they said, “John did no sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.” <b class="verse-num" id="v43010042-1">42&nbsp;</b>And many believed in him there.</p>
